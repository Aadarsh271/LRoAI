## Announcement

This mod is updated to 1.5.4.

version 0.4.2 released.

0.4.2 is a WIP version of my dev build, released as an hotfix for 1.5.4
As far I know, there should be no major bug in this version, but there might be.

Currently rewriting the building decision process from scratch.

## Description

This mod is based on the amazing work of Anbeeld. Unfortunately, he decided to stop supporting ARoAI (that you can find [here](https://github.com/Anbeeld/ARoAI)). I decided to continue his work.

The original mod description was : "**ARoAI** is a mod that focuses on making the AI in Victoria 3 as good as possible at developing economy and infrastructure of the countries controlled by it".

My goal is to completely rewrite it, step by step, to make it better and provide clear documentation so that the community can keep it going when I eventually step back.

## Current performance vs ai

Running an obs game right now.

## Installation
#### Official release

I'll make it officially available on the steam workshop, paradox mods and paradox forum once 1.5 releases.

#### Manual installation

1) Download [the archive](https://github.com/Laaxus/LRoAI/releases) with the latest version.
2) Unpack it so you have a folder named "Laaxus Revision of AI" with mod's contents inside.
3) Go to "Documents > Paradox Interactive > Victoria 3 > mod" or create such a folder if it doesn't exist.
4) Place your "Laaxus Revision of AI" folder here.
