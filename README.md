### Announcement

This mod is **NOT** updated to 1.4.1 yet.

### Description

This mod is based on the amazing work of Anbeeld. Unfortunately, he decided to stop supporting ARoAI (that you can find [here](https://github.com/Anbeeld/ARoAI)). I decided to continue his work.

**Laaxus Revision of AI** aka **LRoAI** is a mod that focuses on making the AI in Victoria 3 as good as possible at developing economy and infrastructure of the countries controlled by it.

Vanilla algorithm of constructing buildings and managing budget is **disabled** in favor of more efficient fully custom scripts, which leads to AI countries being noticeably stronger, including higher **GDP and SoL**.


### Manual installation

1) Download [the archive](https://github.com/Laaxus/LRoAI/releases) with the latest version.
2) Unpack it so you have a folder named "Laaxus Revision of AI" with mod's contents inside.
3) Go to "Documents > Paradox Interactive > Victoria 3 > mod" or create such a folder if it doesn't exist.
4) Place your "Laaxus Revision of AI" folder here.
5) Open launcher and add the mod to your playset or create a new playset with it if you don't have one.
