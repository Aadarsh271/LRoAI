### Description

**Anbeeld's Revision of AI** aka **ARoAI** is a mod that focuses on making the AI in Victoria 3 as strong as possible at internal management of a country.

Vanilla algorithm of constructing buildings and managing budget is **disabled** in favor of fully custom scripts, which **heavily improves economy development** of AI countries, leading to them having much higher GDP and SoL. The same scripts are used to provide players with the **Autobuild** feature that you can enable in the decision tab.
