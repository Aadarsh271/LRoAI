# General info about government building targets
# ----------------------------------------------

# Government buildings don't produce goods in most cases, so you can't judge them by productivity or whatever, you need
# to establish some special measure of how important are they and how much of them a country needs. To solve this two
# values are introduced for each government building, share and target.

# Share is % of budget income of a country that it can spend on this building weekly to pay for wages and input good.
# Usually it's pretty rigid, roughly set to what works the best, but with some dynamic factors added in more cases.
# For example, government administration share is higher when tax capacity is low country-wide. Construction sector
# is special in a sense that it has no base or fixed share, instead it just takes all what's left after other shares.
# Please note that for AI shares are always calculated for normal tax and wage level, otherwise it would be unstable.
# Again consruction sector are special here, they always assume high tax level at the beginning for faster development
# of economy, but when a country won't have much free workforce left, sector will demand less and less money, down to
# normal tax level and even a bit below it.

# Target is arbitrary value on how much stuff a country wants to have, be it spare bureaucracy, innovation, battalions,
# convoys, everything. Except construction sectors, of course. They have no target. Anyways, targets are calculated by
# some random ass formulas, most of the time in some form of population multiplied by some form of GDP per capita, with
# a bunch of other factors thrown in. If country is below target, but expenses already exceed share, it won't construct
# more in most cases, so share acts as a limiter. If country reached target but not share, it may build some more of
# this building cause why not if they are rich enough for that.
