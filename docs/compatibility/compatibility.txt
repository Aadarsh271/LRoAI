ARoAI doesn't support modded buildings without a compatibility patch. Here's how to create one:

0. You can't make any agriculture and most government buildings compatible with ARoAI for the moment due to various
   limitations, but for resource and industry buildings it shouldn't be a problem.

1. Get ID for your future patch here: https://github.com/Anbeeld/ARoAI/issues/4

2. Get ID for all the buildings in the mod here: https://github.com/Anbeeld/ARoAI/issues/5

3. Create a building table. The main building table may be found in /tools/buildings.js, while an example of modded
   building table may be found in /tools/compatibility.js
   The easiest way to do this is by finding a vanilla building that is the most similar to your modded one, copying it
   and then making changes like different key, id and so on. Out of all the attributes you'll need to edit only 3 or 4
   for most buildings. Meaning of every attribute is described in /tools/buildings.js

4. Copy contents of /tools/compatibility.js file to where you'll execute this JavaScript code, which is anywhere from
   browser console (F12) to whatever site you'll get by typing "run js code" in Google. Change compatibility patch ID
   from 1 to yours and insert your building table where it says to do so. Now run the code and get the result.

5. Create file structure same as in /docs/compatibility/example in your compatibility patch folder. It is highly
   recommended to name your files like zzz_aroai_compatibility_X_triggers.txt, where X is your compatibility patch ID.

6. Paste parts of JavaScript execution result separated by comments into effects and triggers respectively.

7. Create evaluate scripted effect for every modded building. Check file in scripted_effects folder of example patch
   to learn how to do it and /src/common/scripted_effects/aroai_static_data_effects.txt for more different examples.

8. Create consider, sanction and allocate scripted triggers for every modded building. Check file in scripted_triggers
   folder of example patch for to learn how to do it and /src/common/scripted_triggers/aroai_static_data_triggers.txt
   for more different examples.

9. Launch the game with the mod you are creating patch for, ARoAI and your new compatibility patch in this order.
   ARoAI may actually go before other mods, but compatibility patches always being at the end is a strict requirement.
   AI countries should build modded buildings through their government queue now. If they don't or if you are getting
   some nasty stuff in error.log, curse me for not making this instruction detailed enough and retry every step of it.
